## Project Structure
This is my production repository for my portfolio website.
It uses Astro v2 and Tailwind.

The goal is to maintain a fast, responsive, modular website that can scale over time.
I keep tinkering with the code as I find the time and don't mind deploying after small changes.

Dependencies:
- Astro
- Tailwind
- DaisyUI 
- Astro ImageTools + Sharp
- Astrojs MDX
- Astrojs Sitemap
- Astro m2dx
- Astropub Icons
- Astro Google Analytics
- Astro SPA
- Sharp

## Roadmap
- Find a better way to implement credits and festival listing
- Optimize image loading further
- Implement a better video component in MDX
- Continue fine-tuning the overall look and feel
- Implement Shared Element Transition API once support has rolled oud. This will allow for deprecating the SPA approach of the current website.
- Further cleaning and streamlining the code. There are many remnants still in place from the previous deployment pre-Astro.
- Streamline MDX formatting and remove the elaborate Picture elements
- Implement a CMS
- Introduce a blog section
