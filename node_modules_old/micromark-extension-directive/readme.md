**[micromark][]** extension to support the [generic directives proposal][prop]
(`:cite[smith04]`, `::youtube[Video of a cat in a box]{v=01ab2cd3efg}`, and
such).

Generic directives solve the need for an infinite number of potential extensions
to markdown in a single markdown-esque way.
However, it’s just [a proposal][prop] and may never be specced.

## When to use this

If you’re using [`micromark`][micromark] or
[`mdast-util-from-markdown`][from-markdown], use this package.
Alternatively, if you’re using **[remark][]**, use
[`remark-directive`][remark-directive].

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c):
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-extension-directive
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.md`:

```markdown
A lovely language know as :abbr[HTML]{title="HyperText Markup Language"}.
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
import fs from 'node:fs'
import {micromark} from 'micromark'
import {directive, directiveHtml} from 'micromark-extension-directive'

const output = micromark(fs.readFileSync('example.md'), {
  extensions: [directive()],
  htmlExtensions: [directiveHtml({abbr})]
})

console.log(output)

function abbr(d) {
  if (d.type !== 'textDirective') return false

  this.tag('<abbr')

  if (d.attributes && 'title' in d.attributes) {
    this.tag(' title="' + this.encode(d.attributes.title) + '"')
  }

  this.tag('>')
  this.raw(d.label || '')
  this.tag('</abbr>')
}
```

Now, running `node example` yields (abbreviated):

```html
<p>A lovely language know as <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.</p>
```

## API

This package exports the following identifiers: `directive`, `directiveHtml`.
There is no default export.

The export map supports the endorsed
[`development` condition](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_resolving_user_conditions).
Run `node --conditions development module.js` to get instrumented dev code.
Without this condition, production code is loaded.

### `directive(syntaxOptions?)`

### `directiveHtml(htmlOptions?)`

Functions that can be called with options to get an extension for micromark to
parse directives (can be passed in `extensions`) and one to compile them to HTML
(can be passed in `htmlExtensions`).

###### `syntaxOptions`

None yet, but might be added in the future.

###### `htmlOptions`

An object mapping names of directives to handlers
([`Record<string, Handle>`][handle]).
The special name `'*'` is the fallback to handle all unhandled directives.

### `function handle(directive)`

How to handle a `directive` ([`Directive`][directive]).

##### Returns

`boolean` or `void` — `false` can be used to signal that the directive could not
be handled, in which case the fallback is used (when given).

### `Directive`

An object representing a directive.

###### Fields

*   `type` (`'textDirective'|'leafDirective'|'containerDirective'`)
*   `name` (`string`) — name of directive
*   `label` (`string?`) — compiled HTML content that was in `[brackets]`
*   `attributes` (`Record<string, string>?`) — object w/ HTML attributes
*   `content` (`string?`) — compiled HTML content inside container directive

## Syntax

The syntax looks like this:

```markdown
Directives in text can form with a single colon, such as :cite[smith04].
Their syntax is `:name[label]{attributes}`.

Leafs (block without content) can form by using two colons:

::youtube[Video of a cat in a box]{vid=01ab2cd3efg}

Their syntax is `::name[label]{attributes}` on its own line.

Containers (blocks with content) can form by using three colons:

:::spoiler
He dies.
:::

The `name` part is required.  The first character must be a letter, other
characters can be alphanumerical, `-`, and `_`.
`-` or `_` cannot end a name.

The `[label]` part is optional (`:x` and `:x[]` are equivalent)†.
When used, it can include text constructs such as emphasis and so on: `x[a *b*
c]`.

The `{attributes}` part is optional (`:x` and `:x{}` are equivalent)†.
When used, it is handled like HTML attributes, such as that `{a}`, `{a=""}`,
, `{a=''}` but also `{a=b}`, `{a="b"}`, and `{a='b'}` are equivalent.
Shortcuts are available for `id=` (`{#readme}` for `{id=readme}`) and
`class` (`{.big}` for `{class=big}`).
When multiple ids are found, the last is used; when multiple classes are found,
they are combined: `{.red class=green .blue}` is equivalent to
`{.red .green .blue}` and `{class="red green blue"}`.

† there is one case where a name must be followed by an empty label or empty
attributes: a *text* directive that only has a name, cannot be followed by a
colon. So, `:red:` doesn’t work. Use either `:red[]` or `:red{}` instead.
The reason for this is to allow GitHub emoji (gemoji) and directives to coexist.

Containers can be nested by using more colons outside:

::::spoiler
He dies.

:::spoiler
She is born.
:::
::::

The closing fence must include the same or more colons as the opening.
If no closing is found, the container runs to the end of its parent container
(block quote, list item, document, or other container).

::::spoiler
These three are not enough to close
:::
So this line is also part of the container.
```

Note that while other implementations are sometimes loose in what they allow,
this implementation mimics CommonMark as closely as possible:

*   Whitespace is not allowed between colons and name (~~`: a`~~), name and
    label (~~`:a []`~~), name and attributes (~~`:a {}`~~), or label and
    attributes (~~`:a[] {}`~~) — because it’s not allowed in links either
    (~~`[] ()`~~)
*   No trailing colons allowed on the opening fence of a container
    (~~`:::a:::`~~) — because it’s not allowed in fenced code either
*   The label and attributes in a leaf or container cannot include line endings
    (~~`::a[b\nc]`~~) — because it’s not allowed in fenced code either
