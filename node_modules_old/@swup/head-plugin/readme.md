# Swup Head Plugin

This plugin will replace the contents of the `<head>` on each page visit.
Useful for adding different stylesheets or meta tags that would otherwise go
ignored.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed with npm

```bash
npm install @swup/head-plugin
```

and included with import

```javascript
import SwupHeadPlugin from '@swup/head-plugin';
```

or included from the dist folder

```html
<script src="./dist/SwupHeadPlugin.js"></script>
```

## Usage

To run this plugin, include an instance in the swup options.

```javascript
const swup = new Swup({
  plugins: [new SwupHeadPlugin()]
});
```

## Options

### persistAssets

Whether to keep orphaned `link`, `style` and `script` tags from the old page
that weren't included on the new page. Useful for third-party libraries that
add custom styles but can only be run once.

Defaults to `false`, i.e. orphaned assets will be removed.

Setting it to `true` acts as a shortcut for setting the `persistTags` option to
a selector of `link[rel=stylesheet], script[src], style`.

```javascript
new SwupHeadPlugin({
  persistAssets: true
})
```

### persistTags

Define which tags will be persisted when a new page is loaded.

Defaults to `false`, i.e. all orphaned tags will be removed.

```javascript
new SwupHeadPlugin({
  // Keep all orphaned tags
  persistTags: true,

  // Keep all tags that match a CSS selector
  persistTags: 'style[data-keep-style]',

  // Use a function to determine whether to keep a tag
  persistTags: (tag) => tag.children.length > 1
})
```

### awaitAssets

Setting this to `true` will delay the transition to the new page until all newly
added assets have finished loading, imitating the standard browser behavior of render-blocking requests. Currently only supports stylesheets.
Defaults to `false`.

```javascript
new SwupHeadPlugin({
  awaitAssets: true
})
```
